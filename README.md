This paper aims to investigate the implementation of Bayesian Neural Networks, in
particular their use in being used to assess the uncertainty within Neural Network model
parameters. It makes use of approximation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo
and Variational Inference in order to implement this Bayesian approach. Through the use of
the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, we shall see how such methods are implemented and
what benefits they may hold. We shall also compare the two methods in order to provide
an overview of the key differences and capabilities they hold.
